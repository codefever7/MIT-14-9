This article briefly presents the potential of MathemaTIC to improve learning, addresses the conditions necessary for its success, outlines the strengths and challenges encountered during its implementation after a one-year pilot phase, and touches upon the first lessons learnt to inform the next steps of the project.

It specifically answers key questions like:

Why MathemaTIC?
Why is MathemaTIC unique?
How does MathemaTIC work?
What conditions enable MathemaTIC to be a success?
