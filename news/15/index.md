MathemaTIC is a personalized learning platform designed to provide students in Grades 3 to 10 with an engaging, real-world learning and assessment experience to strengthen their skills in mathematics.

One of the 2021 CODiE Award reviewers mentioned “[MathemaTIC](https://mathematic.lu/). provides an answer for digital instruction in mathematics for the diverse student population. Customized series of formative and summative assessments guide the user on a personalized path with instructional and real-life learning models. The overall appeal to this program is its ability to provide material in multiple languages seamlessly.
